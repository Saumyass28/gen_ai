# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) QA Bot

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model designed for a Question Answering (QA) bot. The QA bot can retrieve relevant information from a dataset and generate coherent answers using a vector database (Pinecone) and a generative model (Cohere API or alternatives). Additionally, it features an interactive interface built with Streamlit/Gradio, allowing users to upload documents and ask questions.

## Contents
- `Colab Notebook/`: A fully functional Colab notebook demonstrating the entire pipeline from data loading to question answering.
- `app.py`: The main application file for the interactive QA bot interface.
- `Dockerfile`: Configuration for containerizing the application.
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies required for the project.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the repository.
- `docs/`: Additional documentation and example interactions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your machine.
- Access to a Pinecone account for vector storage.
- (Optional) Access to the Cohere API or any other generative model API.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Build the Docker Image**
   ```bash
   docker build --no-cache -t qa_bot .
   ```

3. **Run the Docker Container**
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8501:8501 qa_bot
   ```

4. **Access the Application**
   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`.

### Colab Notebook
The Colab notebook can be found in the `Colab Notebook/` directory. It demonstrates the full pipeline for loading data, processing it, and querying the QA bot.

### Example Queries
- Upload a PDF document through the interface.
- Ask questions like:
  - "What are the main points in the document?"
  - "Summarize the content."
  
The bot will retrieve relevant information and generate responses based on the content of the uploaded document.

## Documentation
For detailed explanations of the model architecture, approach to retrieval, and generative response creation, refer to the documentation in the `docs/` directory.

### Challenges and Solutions
- Discuss challenges faced during implementation (e.g., handling large documents, performance issues) and the solutions you implemented.
